# LinearRegressionTalk

This section is for our Machine Learning discussion group
This is specifically geared towards Linear Regression

This also relates to udemy, course 120, section 7 (Regression)

The corrected answer for that course is here, under the ud-120 folder
Examples are some various code I'll show in the class, if you want to mess with it.

Note: I've included Regression.pptx, because I prefer PowerPoint, 
but also exported it as a pdf file for those who prefer adobe, or use macs.
